                        Global Youth Network for Peace (GYNP) is a global membership association of peacebuilding organizations,
                        professionals and a network of people developing processes for change in the most complex, chaotic 
                        conflict environments in Sierra Leone and around the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are a peacebuilding Nonprofit-Non-Governmental Organization working with and supporting people 
                        at the heart of conflicts who are striving to find solutions to peace and security related issues. 
                        We work with them to deepen our collective understanding of the conflict, bring together divided 
                        communities and create opportunities for them to resolve their differences peacefully.
                    </p>
                    <p>Global Youth Network for Peace believes that only by building a strong and active network of civil society 
                      organizations—each working across political, religious and ethnic boundaries—can a foundation for future 
                      pluralistic and peaceful societies come to fruition. GYNP works to reduce violence everywhere.
                      Global Youth Network for Peace strongly believes that the use of mediation and dialogue in preventing and 
                      resolving violent conflicts in countries around the world is the key to creating sustainable peace.
                      We are committed to the principles of sustainable peace building and development through enhanced governance 
                      for peace and stability, addressing conflict grievances and promoting conflict resolution dialogues at both 
                      National, Regional and Global levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                      The organization was started in Sierra Leone as Youth for Peace and Security Africa – Sierra Leone 
                      Network as one of the oversea networks of the Youth for Peace and Security- Africa to assist national 
                      governments and development partners to respond better to challenges of violence at national level.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                      In the fall of 2019, it became an independent organization from the <i>Youth for Peace and Security Africa</i> to better address the challenges of peace and security around the world.
                      The organization transitioned from within the YPSA auspices to become an independent Non-Governmental and Nonprofit Organization. It maintains a strong link and partnership with the YPSA but now operating as an NGO.
                      We changed our name to Global Youth Network for Peace to reflect the new scope and scale of our work.</p>

                <p>
                  Global Youth Network for Peace’s mandate and approach to work is based on the fundamental belief that
                   the use of mediation and dialogue in preventing, managing and resolving violent conflicts of all types
                  in countries around the world is the key to creating sustainable peace and development.
                </p>
                <p>Research has indicated that investing early to prevent conflicts from escalating into violent crises is, 
                  on average, 60 times more cost effective than intervening after violence erupts.

                discrimination in the workplace, increase youth participation in national governance and national budget allocation
