            <p>This long journey all started on the 5th of March 2019 when a group of eight young, vibrant and passionate 
              youths, headed by Mr. Thomas Kinsley Justice Lebbie held the very first meeting in Kambia after his meeting 
              with the vissionair, Mr. Aloysius Tamba Foryoh in Freetown and exchanged ideas on starting a peace network 
              under the auspice of the Youth for Peace and security Africa.
              This meeting laid the foundation to what is today known as Global youth Network for Peace.

            recruitment into the network and over one hundred applications were received.
            Then, the dream started becoming a reality, as about sixty three of the applicants were recruited, who in turned 
            established the network in their local communities in fulfillment of their volunteer responsibilities.

                <p>
                  The National Youth Conference on Peace and Development wasn’t just a talking shop/show, 
                  it was a gathering of Sierra Leone’s brightest minds in the field of peacebuilding and youth development, 
                  a platform that gave young people the opportunity to hear and be heard on the way forward for Sierra Leone’s 
                  attainment of sustainable peace and development through individual and collective efforts, mostly, the youths. 
                  It laid a foundation for the development of the first ever youth resolution developed by the youths themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the resolution, young people call for the government and private sector to:-
                </p>
                <ul >
                  <li >Humanize justice systems.</li>
                  <li>Foster on equity, social justice, and the promotion of democratic principles and the rule
                    of law in our society.</li>
                  <li>Allocation of special funds for local peacebuilding initiatives</li>
                  <li>Making peace a reality by inclusive participation and many others found in <b>NYCPD
                    Resolution 2019; the voice of young people, reflecting global challenges.</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This prompted us to design a project tagged “project 1,000” meant to direct the talent, energy, 
                  time and efforts of about 200 young Sierra Leoneans in direct peacebuilding efforts in local communities in 
                  Freetown, Bo, Kenema and Makeni respectively to domesticate and conceptualize peacebuilding process in Sierra Leone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is a one year project with possibility of extension that would see the establishment of peace clubs 
                  in 120 schools in the four cities highlighted above; the establishment of community peace dialogue forums 
                  in 120 communities in Freetown, Bo, Kenema and Makeni respectively, training of 200 young Sierra Leoneans 
                  on website designing, digital marketing and mobile application development and hosting the second edition of 
                  the Youth Conference on Peace and Development.
